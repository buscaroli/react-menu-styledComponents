# Objective

Using styled-components in ReactJS for the first time. 
I wanted to get an idea on how to work with the library and if it's something I might consider switching to in the future.

## Considerations

I have to say that after trying styled-components in this little project I am not particularly impressed.

* Lack of syntax highlighting inside the styled-component within VSCode (maybe there is a plugin available ?)
* It pollutes the JSX file with the component, if importing from a separate file might pollute the directory
* It pollutes the HTML as every component needs its element within the HTML hierarchy

I understand the appeal of something like styled-components and if you have ever worked with a framework like SwiftUI for iOS development you probably know that already. However it gives me more the impression of been a patch on a broken cloth.
I'll most certainly follow its future development, but for the time being I think I'll stick to plain CSS/Sass or just a plain CSS Framework. 


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
